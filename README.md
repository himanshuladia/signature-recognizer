# Signature Recognizer

In offline signature verification, the dynamic information of the signature writing process is lost, and it is difficult to design good feature extractors that can distinguish genuine signatures and skilled forgeries. This reflects in a relatively poor performance, with verification errors around 7% in the best systems in the literature. To address both the difficulty of obtaining good features, as well as improve system performance over response time & Scalability issues, we propose learning the representations from signature images, in a Writer-Independent format, using Convolutional Neural Networks & GBDT using XGBoost. 

We introduce a formulation that uses skilled forgeries from a subset of users to guide the feature learning process, using a multi-task framework to jointly optimize the model to discriminate between users (addressing random forgeries), and to discriminate between genuine signatures and skilled forgeries. With our model, we are able to achieve 90% F1 accuracy in  Round 2 dataset as our test dataset. We have used lightweight tools to decrease response time and XGBoost to get best result with least amount of training time.
